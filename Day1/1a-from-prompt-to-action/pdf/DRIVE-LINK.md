Introduction

Artificial intelligence is changing. For years, the focus has been on models that excel at passive, discrete tasks: answering a question, translating text, or generating an image from a prompt. This paradigm, while powerful, requires constant human direction for every step. We're now seeing a paradigm shift, moving from AI that just predicts or creates content to a new class of software capable of autonomous problem-solving and task execution.

This new frontier is built around AI agents. An agent is not simply an AI model in a static workflow; it's a complete application, making plans and taking actions to achieve goals. It combines a Language Model's (LM) ability to reason with the practical ability to act, allowing it to handle complex, multi-step tasks that a model alone cannot. The critical capability is that agents can work on their own, figuring out the next steps needed to reach a goal without a person guiding them at every turn.
