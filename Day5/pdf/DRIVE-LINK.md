Prototype to Production

Authors: Sokratis Kartakis, Gabriela Hernandez Larios, Ran Li, Elia Secchi, and Huang Xia

Introduction

This whitepaper provides a comprehensive technical guide to the operational life cycle of AI agents, focusing on deployment, scaling, and productionizing. Building on Day 4's coverage of evaluation and observability, this guide emphasizes how to build the necessary trust to move agents into production through robust CI/CD pipelines and scalable infrastructure. It explores the challenges of transitioning agent-based systems from prototypes to enterprise- grade solutions, with special attention to Agent2Agent (A2A) interoperability. This guide offers practical insights for AI/ML engineers, DevOps professionals, and system architects.
