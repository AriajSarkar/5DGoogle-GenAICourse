Agent Quality

Authors: Meltem Subasioglu, Turan Bulmus and Wafae Bakkali

Introduction

This is a practical guide from evaluation to observability. We are at the dawn of the agentic era. The transition from predictable, instruction-based tools to autonomous, goal-oriented AI agents presents one of the most profound shifts in software engineering in decades. While these agents unlock incredible capabilities, their inherent non-determinism makes them unpredictable and shatters our traditional models of quality assurance.

This whitepaper serves as a practical guide to this new reality, founded on a simple but radical principle: agent quality is an architectural pillar, not a final testing phase.
