Agent Tools & Interoperability with MCP

Authors: Mike Styer, Kanchana Patlolla, Madhuranjan Mohan, and Sal Diaz

Introduction

In this paper we talk first about the nature of tools used by foundation models: what they are and how to use them. We give some best practices and guidelines for designing effective tools and using them effectively. We then look at the Model Context Protocol, talking about its basic components and some of the challenges and risks it entails. Finally, we take a deeper look at the security challenges posed by MCP as it is introduced in an enterprise environment and connected to high-value external systems.
